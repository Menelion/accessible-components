# Accessible components

Accessible components and patterns with how-to instructions.

## Ideas

- users comment on demos
- each component has a page with how-to steps
- each component has a (separate?) demo page for testing
- login only for commenting?
- demos have versions?
- accept user's requests "to check something on this website and try to solve it"
- share component pages
- rate components
- validation signs (tested in browsers/screen readers)
- https://disqus.com as a commenting platform to test a prototype
- if there are several solutions for one component, split a page content into sections
