# Accessible components

Accessible components and patterns with how-to instructions.

## Ideas

- users comment on demos
- each component has a page with how-to steps
- each component has a (separate?) demo page for testing
  - native js/css
  - simple
  - readable
  - not minified
  - es5 in production
  - link to github?
  - readme for each demo?
- login only for commenting?
- demos have versions?
- new version should be rated again
- accept user's requests "to check something on this website and try to solve it"
- share component pages
  - easy to share
  - nice meta name/description/picture
- rate components
  - accessibility
  - usability?
- validation signs (tested in browsers/screen readers)
  - not valid/partly valid (can be used)/valid
- https://disqus.com as a commenting platform to test a prototype
  - for production custom comments needed
- if there are several solutions for one component
  - split a page content into sections
  - add another page?
